Description: ggworldmap extends ggplot2 by providing geoms for conveniently plotting stylish world maps, in various projections, with shifted central meridian, and pole clipping. It adds functions for projecting and decluttering data that integrate well with magrittr/tidyverse style pipes, and a new 'geom_array' for visualizing categorial quantities using stacked dots in 2D array.
